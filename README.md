# Portfolio
This portfolio website showcases a sleek, modern design tailored for developers and creatives to highlight their skills, projects, and contact information. The site features a continuous, smooth animated background gradient that flows seamlessly across all sections, providing a visually engaging yet subtle effect that maintains a professional look without distraction.

Key aspects of the project include:

Responsive Design: The layout adapts gracefully to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Clean UI/UX: Clear typography and color contrast improve readability and user experience.

Smooth Animations: The background animation uses CSS keyframes to create a dynamic, looping gradient that adds depth and polish to the site.

Interactive Elements: Buttons and project cards feature hover and focus states with subtle transitions for better interactivity.

Accessible and Performant: Minimal use of external resources and semantic HTML ensure fast load times and accessibility compliance.

This project demonstrates proficiency in modern CSS techniques including flexbox, grid, keyframe animations, and responsive styling, making it a strong foundation for any personal or professional portfolio.
